My first HTML/Javascript game. Use a generated maze and fight your way though to the exit. As levels increase, so does difficulty (spawn rates increase).

TODO:
1. Fix bugs on list of known bugs.
2. Allow for enemies to shoot at the player.
3. Different types of enemies (i.e. spawner).
4. Put in actual pictures for characters. Potato for main character and farmers for the rest.
5. Random selection of various levels from map folder.

Possible Ideas:
1. Score board using SQL database.
2. Multiplayer (highly unlikely).
3. Unrestrained movement.

List of Known Bugs:
1. Player can sometimes travel through walls (enemies are supposed to be able to do that).
2. Bullets sometimes travel through walls.
3. Bullets sometimes bounce off enemies.
4. Enemies sometimes despawn.
5. Enemies can spawn outside of map boundaries.
6. Player sometimes automatically dies upon reaching finishing maze.
